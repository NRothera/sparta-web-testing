# Page Object Model - Web Testing using Selenium and Capybara

The page object model refers to how we design our code to be readable, maintainable and reusable in relation to testing web pages.

For instance, each web page being tested should have their own file and class. The methods within these classes should be name well. For example, a function that inputs a password should be named ``` def fill_in_password ```

Selenium and Capybara are tools we can use to help us interact with the elements on a webpage and aid us in automating web testing. They mimic the process a real person would use when on your webpage.
